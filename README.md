#uhmActually
This project was created at technica 2023

## Inspiration
We all have that *one* friend. You know them. They are an endless fountain of inspiration, constantly telling new and interesting facts. However, sometimes they will hold all of their knowledge over you like you are a hopeless idiot- which to be fair- is often true. 

I have created a discord bot to share different types of fun facts and knowledge so that the rest of us can compensate.

## What it does
This Discord bot has four primary functions currently:
- displays the Wikipedia page of the day
- uses the Wikipedia API to gain access to interesting things and events that happened in the past on the given date
- uses the Wikipedia API to search through Wikipedia and gives short descriptions of the results. 
- Plays a small trivia game

## How we built it
 The project is made completely out of JavaScript using Node and the Wikipedia API, discord.js, and the Open Trivia Database. 

I started by setting up the bot using discord.js, which is a library I have never used before. Then I moved on to setting up the Wikipedia commands, and finally adding the trivia aspect. 

## Challenges we ran into
For me personally, the most challenging things were interacting with libraries and APIs that I have never used before and the harsh time limit. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
I am proud that I was able to push out a product that has all the commands that I set out for it to have. 

## What we learned
I am so much more familiar with all the different APIs that I used, especially discord.js. I honestly just learned a lot about completing a project in general! 

## What's next for uhmActually - discord bot
